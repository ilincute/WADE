                        The Palace of Culture - palace of museums, acknowledged as an effigy of the city of Iaşi, was built
                         in neo gothic style, representing one of the last expressions of Romanticism in the official 
                         architecture. Although it was not built on top of ancient foundations, as it was assumed at the 
                         beginning of the 20th century, the Palace partially stands on the ruins of the medieval 
                         princelycourts, mentioned in documents of 1434.
                        
                        The foundations of the old (neo classic) palace of Prince Alexandru Moruzi (1806-1812), rebuilt by 
                        Mihail Sturza (1841-1843) and demolished in 1904, were also used. It is from this construction that 
                        the Palace inherited the legend of its 365 chambers, as many as the number of days in a year.

                        The monument, built between 1906-1925, is the most significant creation of the Romanian architect 
                        I.D. Berindei, who had studied at the Parisian school.
